- go[side][side] ain't work

- (go1[side] - go2[side]) and (go1[side] % go2[side]) ain't work - Solved, I believe

- periodic O-grid ain't work - Solved, I believe

- go1.replace(go2[side]) ain't work for O-grids as well as normal grids - Solved, I believe

- raise_multiplicity, does not work for O-grids
	the issue is, I believe that:
	#####
	knots = numpy.concatenate( [ knots[-p-1:-1] -1 , knots, knots[1: p+1] + 1] )
	is only valid for knot-repetitions of one
	or possibly
	T_ = T
        T = T[:n-2*p,:m-2*p]
        T[:,0:p] += T_[:n-2*p,m-2*p: m-2*p+p]
	in prolongation matrix.
	ref and ref_by seems to work fine for some reason though.
	#####
- ref_by, add_knot does not work for O-grids with repeated knots - something is wrong in the dimension of the prolongation matrix, I believe
	- correction it works if the knot-repetition is far enough removed from the 0th or last knot - Fixed, I believe

- ref does not work for jac_go  (possibly the same issue as raise multiplicity)  - Fixed, I believe

- linear elasticity sometimes doesn't work. The resulting mapping has its weights mutliplied by a constant factor that shouldn't be there.
  Also some resolution gets lost.
